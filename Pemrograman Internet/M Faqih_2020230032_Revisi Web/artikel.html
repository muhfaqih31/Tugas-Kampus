          <h1>SQL Injection</h1>
          <p>SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.</p>
          <p>SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.</p>
          <p>SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.</p>
          
          <h1>SQL in Web Pages</h1>
          <p>SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.</p>
          
          <p>Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):</p>
          <code>txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");<br>
            txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;</code>

          <h1 class="mt-3">SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True</h1>
          <p>Look at the example above again. The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.

            If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:
            
          </p>

          <p>UserId: <input type="text" name="UserId" value="105 OR 1=1"></p>

          <p>Then, the SQL statement will look like this:</p>

          <div class="w3-example">
            <div class="w3-code notranslate sqlHigh"><span class="sqlcolor" style="color:black">
            <span class="sqlkeywordcolor" style="color:mediumblue">SELECT</span> * <span class="sqlkeywordcolor" style="color:mediumblue">FROM</span> Users <span class="sqlkeywordcolor" style="color:mediumblue">WHERE</span> UserId = <span class="sqlnumbercolor">105</span> <span class="sqlkeywordcolor" style="color:mediumblue">OR</span> <span class="sqlnumbercolor">1</span>=<span class="sqlnumbercolor">1</span>; </span></div>
          </div>

          <p>The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since <strong>
            OR 1=1</strong> is always TRUE.</p>
  
          <p>Does the example above look dangerous? What if the "Users" table contains names and passwords?</p>

          <h1>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

          <p>Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.</p>
        
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.</p>

          <h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
          <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p>
          
          <h2>Type of Cyber Threats</h2>
          <p class="MsoNormal" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The threats countered by cyber-security are three-fold:</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><a href="/resource-center/threats/cybercrime"><strong><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Cybercrime</span></strong></a></span> includes single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to cause disruption.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. <strong>Cyber-attack</strong> often involves politically motivated information gathering.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. <strong>Cyberterrorism</strong> is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear.</p>
